My name is Robert Quimbey though I'm often called Q since I'm commonly one of many Rob's, Bob's, and Robert's on an extended team. I work for [Pure Storage](https://www.purestorage.com/ "purestorage") as a Field Solutions Architect (FSA).  I get to spend most of my time helping customers Migrate to [Microsoft Solutions](https://support.purestorage.com/bundle/m_microsoft_platform_guide/page/Solutions/topics/reference/r_microsoft_platform_guide.html "microsoftsolutions"), and for existing customers, develop more value out of their existing Pure Storage infrastructure. 

I have spent the past couple of decades working with Microsoft Software, and even spent almost 9 years in the Exchange team in Redmond at Microsoft! I focus on automation with PowerShell, databases, storage technologies, Windows (and Linux \:), Failover Clustering, and even Azure.

Most of my posts will be Pure Storage focused, but I hope to share information that can be applicable to many, even not-yet Pure customers! I owe a huge debt to [Robert Barker aka Barkz](https://gleaningideas.ai/ "Barkz"), whose very large shoes I am attempting to fill, by pushing the boundaries of Microsoft Solutions here at Pure. Having recently helped both a 2-node Hyper-V shop, and a 300-node synchronously replicated multiple stretched clusters customer, we see all sizes and are ready with integrations, snapshots, Cyber Resiliency, replication, and more!

I want to call out and thank two of my FSA mentors, and pretty **epic** Microsoft SQL Server experts, who have encouraged me to start blogging: [Andy Yun](https://sqlbek.wordpress.com/ "sqlbek") and [Anthony Nocentino](https://www.nocentino.com/ "Nocentino"). Anthony even gave a show and tell where he demonstrated how easy Hugo was to use with Github so when I finally implemented it, I even copied his theme! After all, “Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness.”
